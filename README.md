<h1>NSS Cal Project</h1>
<hr>
<p>This is a project for the Nashville Software School, in which I'm building a Ruby command line program that can print out the calendar (a la the cal command) of a given month and/or year.</p>
<em><p>This project is incomplete</p></em>
<hr>
<h3>Phase 1</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Write integration tests for the several edgecases that deal with leap year integration.</li>
  <li>Utilize sample cal implementation to make tests pass.</li>
</ul>
